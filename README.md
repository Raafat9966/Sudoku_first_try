I need help from anyone who can give me good advice, I had a trial day in a company for an apprenticeship and I've been asked to write this program which can solve Sudoku. After I've finished the code, I received rejection from the company and they didn't tell the reason even after I've asked for it. All the written code is here, I hope someone can give me feedback. 
Thanks.
